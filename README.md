# random-functions-reference-solutions-cheat-sheet


A collection of solutions I've used/created to solve various problems along the way.

Like it says, a "spare parts bin" to mix, match, and play around with. 

    - Functions are labeled with a brief description explaining what the code is used for.

    - 'main.py' contains assorted general purpose functions.
    
    - 'math.py' contains more (..you guessed it!) math related functions.

   Some are answers to common things you may run into, while others are more unique.
But none the less, 
they can serve as a reference while attempting to solve any related
problems or perform similar tasks. 

   So, that's it really. Just a little helper sheet to keep handy and hopefully 
be of some use and inspiration. :)

 
 
 - Happy Coding!
